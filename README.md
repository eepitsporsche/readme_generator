## Description
The README Generator provides users with an easy-to-use program to create a professional README for their project. User input taken from a series of prompts is applied to the program to produce a README file with dynamic markdown syntax.

Future development for this app could include the feature of omitting a section when no entry has been made by the user.


## Installation
[Inquirer v8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) must be installed to operate this app.

## Usage
[Clone the repository](https://github.com/eepitsporsche/readme_generator) to your machine and open the application in VS Code.

After answering the prompts, a README file entitled "generated-README.md" with the user's reponses will be created.
